11 months after my first attempt, I sat down to attack the BTL2 exam a second time this past weekend. The student must analyze a 'realistic intrusion' scenario and is provided 72 hours to do so. It is the capstone of the BTL2 course, covering the four primary domains of the Blue Team Level 2 course content: malware analysis, threat hunting, advanced siem, and vulnerability management.

I used the pomodoro technique in 1 hour increments to stay focused and to provide myself opportunities to take brief breaks, as I knew it was going to be an exhausting weekend. The breakdown of my efforts: 10/27 (9h), 10/28 (9h),  10/29 (6h) [24-25 hours total]. If the amount of time spent seems unfathomable, I can assure you it goes by quickly as you threat hunt and go through the copious amount of data presented.

I will not receive my grade for a minimum of 30 days as my report is in their queue and exams are hand graded. Once received, I will provide my thoughts on the BTL2 certification and its place in the certification industry.
